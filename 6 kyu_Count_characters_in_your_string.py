# The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

# What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

# def count(string):
#     # The function code should be here
#     return {}

def count(string):
    return {c:string.count(c) for c in string}
